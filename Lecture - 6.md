### Types of Market Structure

The main criteria by which one can distinguish between different market structures are: the number and size of producers and consumers in the market, the type of goods and services being traded, and the degree to which information can flow freely. There are mainly four types of Market. This are-

### Perfect Competition

Perfect competition describes a market structure, where a large number of small firms compete against each other. In this scenario, a single firm does not have any significant market power. As a result, the industry as a whole produces the socially optimal level of output, because none of the firms have the ability to influence market prices.

The idea of perfect competition builds on a number of assumptions: (1) all firms maximize profits (2) there is free entry and exit to the market, (3) all firms sell completely identical (i.e. homogenous) goods, (4) there are no consumer preferences. By looking at those assumptions it becomes quite obvious, that we will hardly ever find perfect competition in reality. This is an important aspect because it is the only market structure that can (theoretically) result in a socially optimal level of output.

Thus, Perfect competition, a theoretical market structure that features low barriers to entry, identical products with no differentiation, an unlimited number of producers and consumers, and a perfectly elastic (linear) demand curve.

### Monopolistic Competition

Monopolistic competition also refers to a market structure, where a large number of small firms compete against each other. However, unlike in perfect competition, the firms in monopolistic competition sell similar, but slightly differentiated products. This gives them a certain degree of market power which allows them to charge higher prices within a certain range.

Monopolistic competition builds on the following assumptions: (1) all firms maximize profits (2) there is free entry and exit to the market; (3) firms sell differentiated products (4) consumers may prefer one product over the other. Now, those assumptions are a bit closer to reality than the ones we looked at in perfect competition. However, this market structure will no longer result in a socially optimal level of output, because the firms have more power and can influence market prices to a certain degree. An example of monopolistic competition is the market for cereals. There is a huge number of different brands (e.g. Cap’n Crunch, Lucky Charms, Froot Loops, Apple Jacks). Most of them probably taste slightly different, but at the end of the day, they are all breakfast cereals.

Thus, Monopolistic competition, a type of imperfect competition such that many producers sell products or services that are differentiated from one another (e.g. by branding or quality) and hence are not perfect substitutes. In monopolistic competition, a firm takes the prices charged by its rivals as given and ignores the impact of its own prices on the prices of other firms. This market structure exists when there are multiple sellers who are attempting to seem different from one another.

### Oligopoly

An oligopoly describes a market structure which is dominated by only a small number of firms. This results in a state of limited competition. The firms can either compete against each other or collaborate (see also Cournot vs. Bertrand Competition). By doing so they can use their collective market power to drive up prices and earn more profit.

The oligopolistic market structure builds on the following assumptions: (1) all firms maximize profits, (2) oligopolies can set prices, (3) there are barriers to entry and exit in the market, (4) products may be homogenous or differentiated, and (5) there are only a few firms that dominate the market. To give an example of an oligopoly, let’s look at the market for gaming consoles. This market is dominated by three powerful companies: Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo. This leaves all of them with a significant amount of market power.

Thus, Oligopoly, in which a market is run by a small number of firms that together control the majority of the market share. Duopoly, a special case of an oligopoly with two firms. Monopsony, when there is only a single buyer in a market. Oligopsony, a market where many sellers can be present but meet only a few buyers.

### Monopoly

A monopoly refers to a market structure where a single firm controls the entire market. In this scenario, the firm has the highest level of market power, as consumers do not have any alternatives. As a result, monopolies often reduce output to increase prices and earn more profit.

The following assumptions are made when we talk about monopolies: (1) the monopolist maximizes profit, (2) it can set the price, (3) there are high barriers to entry and exit, (4) there is only one firm that dominates the entire market. From the perspective of society, most monopolies are usually not desirable, because they result in lower outputs and higher prices compared to competitive markets. Therefore, they are often regulated by the government. An example of a real-life monopoly could be Monsanto. About 80% of all corn harvested in the US is trademarked by this company. That gives Monsanto an extremely high level of market power. You can find additional information about monopolies our post on monopoly power.

Thus, Monopoly, where there is only one provider of a product or service.

### Demand Curve of a Product in a Perfectly Competitive Market

Let’s derive the firm’s demand curve with the help of the market’s demand and supply curve. In perfect competition, the equilibrium of the market’s demand and supply determines the price.

[Description of the graph: There are two panels side by side. Left panel labeled "Industry" shows downward-sloping Demand (D) curve and upward-sloping Supply (S) curve intersecting at price P and quantity Q. Right panel labeled "Firm" shows a horizontal line at price P labeled AR = MR, extending from quantity 0 to X.]

In the figure above, Price is on the Y-axis and Quantity on the X-axis. The left side of the figure represents the industry and the right side the case of a firm. The market demand curve is DD and the market supply curve is SS. Further, the point at which market’s demand and supply

### Principle of optimization

In microeconomic modeling, the economic environment is divided up into two types of economic agents: producers and consumers. The underlying goals behind the actions of these agents is based on optimizing behavior -- the maximization of something subject to {s.t.} particular constraints. In the case of producers (or business firms), the goal is to maximize profits subject to the constraint of existing technology and know-how. For consumers (or households), the goal is to maximize utility subject to the constraint imposed by household income and market prices.

### The problem facing the Consumer:

max U = f(X₁,X₂,...,Xₙ) -- the objective function  
s.t. Σ_{i=1 to n} P_i X_i ≤ I -- the constraint  

Here,  
U ... "Utility" -- the satisfaction gained from choosing a particular bundle of goods.  
X_i ... quantity of the iᵗʰ good consumed  
P_i ... Price of the iᵗʰ good.  
I ... Consumer Income.

### The problem facing the Producer:

max π = P_x X - [wL + rK + nM + aR] -- the objective function [Revenues - Costs].  
s.t. X = f(L,K,M,R) -- the constraint [the production function]  

Here,  
π ... Profits  
P_x ... the market determined price of good 'X'.  
X ... the quantity of good 'X' produced.  
L, K, M, & R ... the factors of production. L = Labor, K = Capital, M = Land and Raw Materials, R = Entrepreneurship.  
w, r, n, & a ... factor prices: w = Wages, r = rental cost of capital, n = rents and material prices, a = the normal rate of profit.
