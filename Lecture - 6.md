### Theory of Production

Factors of Production: There are mainly four factors of production. These are—

1. Land/Natural Resources: Land refers to all natural resources. These resources are gifts that are given by nature. Some typical examples of natural resources are water, oil, copper, natural gas, coal, and forests. These resources can be renewable, such as forests, or nonrenewable such as oil or natural gas. The income earned from land or other such natural resources is called rent.

2. Labor: Labor, as a factor of production, involves any human input. The quality of labor depends on the workforce's skills, education, and motivation. Generally speaking, the higher the quality of labor, the more productive is the workforce. If someone has ever paid you for a job, you have contributed labor resources to the production of goods or services. Labor can be physical or mental. The income earned by labor resources is called wages. It is the largest source of income for most people.

3. Capital: Here capital refers to manufactured resources such as factories and machines. These are man-made goods used in the production of other goods. Their use in commercial production is what separates them from consumer goods.

Some other examples of capital include hammers, forklifts, conveyor belts, computers, and delivery vans. An increase in capital goods means an increase in the productive capacity of the economy. The income earned by owners of capital resources is interest.

4. Entrepreneurship: An entrepreneur is someone who takes on the risk and brings the other three factors of production together. Entrepreneurs are a vital engine of economic growth, helping to build some of the largest firms in the world as well as some of the small businesses in your neighborhood. The payment an entrepreneur receives is called profit as a reward for the risk they take.

A firm's objective is profit maximization. If, in the short run, its total output remains fixed (due to capacity constraints) and if it is a price-taker (i.e., cannot fix the price or change price on its own as in a purely competitive market) its total revenue will also remain fixed. Therefore, the only way to maximize profit is to minimize cost. Thus profit maximization and cost minimization are the two sides of the same coin. Moreover, supply depends on cost of production. The decision to supply an extra unit depends on the marginal cost of producing that unit. Perhaps the most important determinant of the firm's price-output decision in any market is its cost of production.

The firm's cost, in its turn, depends on two main factors:
(1) The technical relation between inputs and output (i.e., how outputs vary as inputs vary), and
(2) Factors price's (i.e., the price of labor or the wage, the price of capital or the interest rate, etc.). In this article we will discuss a new concept, called production function. In this context we will clear a distinction between the short-run and the long-run as also between the return to a factor and the return to scale.

The business firm is a technical unit in which inputs are converted into output for sale to consumers, other business firms and various government departments. In the theory of production we are concerned with the nature of the conversion process, i.e., how inputs are converted into output. The key concept in the theory of production is the production function.

The Production Function:
The production function shows the relation between input changes and output changes. It also shows the maximum amount of output that can be obtained by the firm from a fixed quantity of resources. The production function is expressed as:

Q = f(K, L, etc.)

Where Q is output (which is the dependent variable) and K and L are capital and labour inputs, respectively. We can think of other inputs as well, such as land. For the sake of convenience we assume here that the firm employs only two factors of production—labour and capital. The firm's output is treated as a flow, i.e., so many units per period of time. The volume of output of the firm's product, per period of time, depends on the quantities of these factors that are used by the firm.

Let us now suppose that the firm wishes to increase its volume (rate) of output. This can be achieved by increasing the inputs of one or both factors of production. However, it is very easy to vary the quantity of labour in the production process. It can be done very quickly (in a week or a month). On the other hand, a fairly long period of time is required to vary the quantity of other factors, for example, change the quantity (or usage) of capital, e.g. to install a new machine. The speed with which different kinds of factors can be varied largely depends on the time period under consideration. Here we assume that the firm is making decisions within two time periods —the short-run and the long-run.

The Short-Run and the Long-Run:
The distinction between the short-run and the long-run is based on the difference between fixed and variable factors. A factor of production is treated as a fixed factor if it cannot easily be varied over the time period under consideration. On the other hand, a variable factor is one which can be varied over the time period under consideration.

The Short-Run:
The short-run refers to the period of time over which one (or more) factor(s) of production is (are) fixed. In the real world, land and capital (such as plant and equipment) are usually treated as fixed factors. Here we are considering a simple production process with only two factors. We treat capital as the fixed factor and labour as the variable factor. Thus, output becomes a function of (i.e., output depends on the usage of) the variable factor labour working on a fixed quantity of capital. In other words, if the firm wishes to vary its production in the short-run, it can do so only by changing the quantity of labour. With a fixed quantity of capital, this necessitates changing the proportions in which labour and capital are combined in the production process.

The Long-Run:
On the other hand the long-run is defined as the period over which all factors of production can be varied, within the confines of existing technology. In the long-run all factors are variable. Moreover the long-run also permits factor substitution. More capital and less labour or more labour and less capital can be used to produce a fixed amount of output. Table 6.1 illustrates the relationship between input changes and output changes in the short run. Three concepts bear relevance in this context, viz., total product (TP), average product (AP) and marginal product (MP). Here Q is total product. It refers to the total amount produced by all the factors employed in a fixed time period. AP is output per unit of input. It is calculated by dividing TP by the amount of the variable factor, e.g., labour (L).

So, AP = TP/L = Q/L is output per unit of labour or per worker. The marginal product is defined as the change in total product associated with a small change in the usage of the variable factor. It may be expressed as, MP = ΔQ/ΔL where 'Δ' denotes any change. Thus, MP is the ratio of the change in Q and change in L.

Fig. 6.1. Total product, marginal product and average product and average product of a variable factor, used with a fixed factor in the short run

The data presented in Table 6.1 are shown graphically in Fig. 6.1. In Table 6.1 we show the total product that results from employing 1 to 9 units of labour [Column (i)] in combination with a fixed quantity (10 units), of capital, [column (ii)]. Column (iv) shows the corresponding AP figures. Each figure of column (iv) is arrived at by dividing each element of Column (iii) by the corresponding element of Column (i). Column (v) gives the MP figures.

Each element in this column shows the contribution (addition) made to the total product (TP) by the one additional unit of labour. In other words, MP is the change in total product which results from a change in the usage of the variable factor (i.e., labour) by one unit. For example, when one unit of labour is employed, TP is 4. When two units are employed, TP is 10. Therefore, the anticipation of the said unit of labour is 10 - 4 = 6 units. This is the MP of labour.

Three Stages of Production Process:
If we look at Table 6.1 carefully we can identify three stages of the production process in the short-run:

(1) In the first stage, when additional units of labour are employed, TP increases more than proportionately and MP also increases. This is the stage of increasing return to the variable factor (labour).

(2) In the second stage TP increases no doubt, but not proportionately. In other words, the rate of increase of TP falls. This means that MP diminishes. This is the stage of diminishing return to the variable factor (labour). This is perhaps the most important stage of the production process in the short run.

(3) In the third stage, TP itself diminishes and the MP is negative. This is the stage of negative return to the variable factor (labour).

The three stages together constitute the Law of Variable Proportions. Since the second stage is most important from the practical point of view, we often ignore the other two stages in most discussions. This is why the Law of Variable Proportions is also known as the Law of Diminishing Returns, which is universally applicable. The Law states that "when increasing quantities of a variable factor are used in combination with a fixed factor, the marginal and average product of the variable factor will eventually decrease." In our example AP increases until 5 men are employed. It declines thereafter. MP declines earlier. It rises until 4 men are employed and declines when 5 and more men are employed.

No doubt, the data presented in Table 6.1 are hypothetical. But the relationship shown among TP, MP and AP is widely applicable. From Table 6.1 we may also discover the relationship between MP and AP.

Three points may be noted in this context:
1. So long as MP exceeds AP, the AP must be rising.
2. Thus, it follows as a corollary of this that only when MP falls below the level of AP, does AP fall.
3. Since MP rises when MP is exceeding AP, while AP falls where MP is less than AP, it follows that where AP is at a maximum, it is equal to MP. This is why; the MP curve intersects the AP curve at the latter's maximum point. (The relation between the margin and the average is mathematical.)

In this context we may note that MP can be zero or negative, but AP can never be so. AP may be very small but is always positive as long as TP is positive. However, such a situation does not carry any significance. In an example where 9 men are employed, TP falls. So no profit-maximizing producer would consider employing so many workers.

### Types of Productivity

Productivity is the ratio of the amount of output from a team or organization per unit of input. Conceptually productivity is a simple metric. The metric is a sign of how efficiently a team or organization has organized and managed the piece of work being measured. There are four types of productivity. Each type of productivity focuses on a different part of the supply chain needed to deliver a product or a service. The four types are:

- Labor productivity is the ratio output per person. Labor productivity measures the efficiency of the labor in the transformation of something into a product of higher value. In software development terms, labor productivity is a measure of the efficient use of the effort needed to write and implement the code.

- Capital productivity is the ratio of output (goods or services) to the input of physical capital. Improving physical capital (known as capital deepening) typically yields an increase in output. In software development, physical capital includes the equipment, buildings or other items like computers needed to develop and implement the code.

- Material productivity is the ratio of output to the input of materials (also known as natural resources). In software development, there are very little material or natural resources that are used. Material productivity plays a larger role when considering the manufacture of hardware/software packages, such as an ATM.

- Total Factor productivity (TFP) is not a simple ratio of output to input, but rather it is a measure that captures everything that is not captured as labor, capital or material productivity. Factors included in total factor productivity include attributes like changes in general knowledge, the use of particular organizational structures, management techniques, or returns on the scale. The components in TFP are often the sources of productivity changes in software development.

Productivity is important because it defines the efficiency of an organization in converting inputs into output. In the 20th century, we got used to productivity being a relatively simple concept. Steel makers take raw materials, people, and machines and create steel. If we calculating the productivity of a steel maker, we would measure the amount of steel created and then divide it by the amount of raw material, cost of machines or the amount of effort needed. Calculating software productivity is not substantially different.
