National income accounting
What is national accounting?
National income accounting refers to the set of methods and principles that are used by the government for measuring production and income, or in other words economic activity of a country in a given time period.
The various measures of determining national income are GDP (Gross Domestic Product), GNP (Gross National Product), and NNP (Net National Product) along with other measures such as personal income and disposable income.

What is the national income accounting equation?
National income accounting equation is an equation that shows the relationship between income and expense of an economy and other categories. It is represented by the following equation:
Y = C + I + G + (X – M)
Where
Y = National income
C = Personal consumption expenditure
I = Private investment
G = Government spending
X = Net exports
M = Imports
The most important metrics that are determined by national income accounting are GDP, GNP, NNP, disposable income, and personal income. Let us know more about these concepts briefly in the following lines.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
The most important metric that is determined by national income accounting is GDP or the gross domestic product. GDP is defined as the total monetary or the market value of all the final goods and services that are produced within the geographical boundaries of a country.
GDP works as a scorecard that reflects the economic health of a country. It is calculated on an annual basis. GDP helps in estimating the growth rate of a country. GDP can be calculated using the three methods, which are expenditures method, production method, and income method.
The other indicators of national income are derived from GDP.
GDP can be calculated by the following two methods:
1.	Expenditure approach
2.	Income approach
Calculation of GDP by expenditure approach is,
GDP = C + I + G + (X – M)

Where
GDP = Gross domestic product
C = Personal consumption expenditure
I = Private investment
G = Government spending
X = Net exports
M = Imports
Income approach calculation
GDP = Private consumption + Gross investment + Government investment + Government spending + (Exports – Imports)

Gross National Product (GNP)
Gross national product or GNP is a measure of the total value of all the finished goods and services that is produced by the citizens of a country irrespective of their geographic location. It calculates only the final or finished goods.
It signifies how much the citizens of a country are contributing to the economy. It does not include income earned by foreign nationals within the country.
GNP is calculated using the following formulae:
GNP = C + I + G + X + Z
Where
C = Consumption
I = Investment
G = Government
X = Net exports
Z = Net factor income from abroad

Depreciation In the course of production the fixed capital (plants and machinery) undergoes routine wear and tear which signifies the extent of consumption of fixed capital. Additionally, over time the machinery tends to becomes outdated or obsolete, even if perfect in the working condition. To avoid over estimating the national product, we create a provision for this wear and tear or depreciation as well as the routine obsolescence. Hence, if we have a gross estimate of the national product, subtracting the depreciation would give us the net national product.
Net Domestic Product (NDP): NDP is the value of net output of the economy during the year. Some of the country‟s capital equipment wears out or becomes obsolete each year during the production process. The value of this capital consumption or depreciation is some percentage of gross investment which is deducted from GDP. Thus 
NDP = GDP - Depreciation
Net National Product (NNP): NNP is the value of final goods and services produced in the current period by domestically-owned factors of production at home or abroad after allowing for the depreciation of fixed capital during any particular year. Thus, NNP is the deduction of the consumption of fixed capital or the depreciation allowance from GNP. In other words, Net national product or NNP is the total value of all goods and services that are produced in a country during a given period of time minus the depreciation. It is represented as follows:
NNP = GNP - Depreciation
Nominal and Real GDP The value of GDP for a country changes from time to time. The same goes for prices of goods and services that keep fluctuating from time to time. If prices change, then there may be difficulties in comparing GDPs. If we measure the GDP of a country in two consecutive years and see that the figure for GDP of the latter year is twice that of the previous year, we may conclude that the volume of production of the country has doubled. But it is possible that only prices of all goods and services have doubled between the two years whereas the production has remained constant. Therefore, in order to compare the GDP figures of different countries or to compare the GDP figures of the same country at different points of time, we cannot rely on GDPs evaluated at current market prices. For comparison we take the help of real GDP. Real GDP is calculated in a way such that the goods and services are evaluated at some constant set of prices (or constant prices). Since these prices remain fixed, if the Real GDP changes we can be sure that it is the volume of production which is undergoing changes. Nominal GDP, on the other hand, is simply the value of GDP at the current prevailing prices.

Nominal GDP measures the value of output at the prices prevailing at the time of production, while real GDP measures the output produced in any one period at the prices of some base year. The growth rate of the economy is usually taken to be the rate at which real GDP is increasing. Table 1 illustrates the concepts. The current year is 2010 and the base year is 2004.
Table 1 Current Quantities 	Current Year(2010) prices 	Base Year(2004) prices 
Apple 	8 	6 	4 
Orange 	4 	3 	7 
Pen 	10 	2 	5 

Current or Nominal GDP = 8x6+4x3+10x2=80
Real GDP = 8x4+4x7+10x5=110







Methods of National Income Accounting
There are three methods of measuring national income. They are as follows:
1.	Product method: In this method, a country’s national income can be calculated by adding the output of all the firms in the economy to determine the nation’s output.
2.	Income method: This method is used to calculate incomes generated by production. It includes income from employment, rent obtained for buildings, patents, and copyrights, return on capital from the private sector and public sector, depreciation, etc.
3.	Expenditure method: In this method, the national income is calculated by adding all the expenditures that are done for purchasing the national output.

Functions of National Income Accounting
The basic functions of national income accounting are as follows:
1.	To determine the economic status of a country.
2.	To provide a basis of evaluation and reviewing of policies that are under implementation.

Uses of National Income Accounting
Uses of national income accounting are as follows:
1.	It reflects the economic performance of an economy and shows its strengths and weaknesses.
2.	It helps to determine the structural changes that are appearing in the economy.
3.	It helps in comparing nations based on national income.
4.	It shows the contribution of each sector towards the growth of the economy.

CIRCULAR FLOW OF INCOME
In this model, the economy is assumed to be a closed economy and consists of only two sectors, i.e., the household and the firms. There is only one way in which the households may dispose off their earnings – by spending their entire income on the goods and services produced by the domestic firms. The other channels of disposing their income are closed: we have assumed that the households do not save, they do not pay taxes to the government – since there is no government, and neither do they buy imported goods since there is no external trade in this simple the goods and services which they assisted in producing. The aggregate consumption by the households of the economy is equal to the aggregate expenditure on goods and services produced by the firms in the economy. The entire income of the economy, therefore, comes back to the producers in the form of sales revenue. There is no leakage from the system – there is no difference between the amount that the firms had distributed in the form of factor payments (which is the sum total of remunerations earned by the four factors of production) and the aggregate consumption expenditure that they receive as sales revenue. 

In the next period the firms will once again produce goods and services and pay remunerations to the factors of production. These remunerations will once again be used to buy the goods and services. Hence year after year we can imagine the aggregate income of the economy going through the two sectors, firms and households, in a circular way. This is represented in figure. When the income is being spent on the goods and services produced by the firms, it takes the form of aggregate expenditure received by the firms. Since the value of expenditure must be equal to the value of goods and services, we can equivalently measure the aggregate income by “calculating the aggregate value of goods and services produced by the firms”. When the aggregate revenue received by the firms is paid out to the factors of production it takes the form of aggregate income.

 

In the above figure, the uppermost arrow, going from the households to the firms, represents the spending the households undertake to buy goods and services produced by the firms. The second arrow going from the firms to the households is the counterpart of the arrow above. It stands for the goods and services which are flowing from the firms to the households. In other words, this flow is what the households are getting from the firms, for which they are making the expenditures. In short, the two arrows on the top represent the goods and services market – the arrow above represents the flow of payments for the goods and services, the arrow below represents the flow of goods and services. The two arrows at the bottom of the diagram similarly represent the factors of production market. The lower most arrow going from the households to the firms symbolizes the services that the households are rendering to the firms. Using these services the firms are manufacturing the output. The arrow above this, going from the firms to the households, represents the payments made by the firms to the households for the services provided by the latter. 
Since the same amount of money, representing the aggregate value of goods and services is moving in a circular way, if we want to estimate the aggregate value of goods and services produced during a year we can measure the annual value of the flows at any of the dotted lines 12 
indicated in the diagram. We can measure the uppermost flow by measuring the aggregate value of spending that the firms receive for the final goods and services which they produce. This method will be called the expenditure method. The upper flow from firm to household measures the aggregate value of final goods and services produced by all the firms; it will be called product method. The lower flow from firm to household measures the sum total of all factor payments will be called income method. Here aggregate spending of the economy must be equal to the aggregate income earned by the factors of production since the same flow is being measured at two different points.

Optimization

Optimization is a predominant theme in management and economic analysis. For this reason, the classical calculus methods of finding free and constrained extrema and the more recent techniques of mathematical programming occupy an important place in management and economics. The most common criterion of choice among alternatives in economics is the goal of maximizing something (i.e. profit maximizing, utility maximizing, growth rate maximizing etc.) or of minimizing something (i.e. cost minimizing). Economically, we may categorize such maximization and minimization problems under the general heading of optimization, which means ‘the quest for the best’. The present lesson is devoted to a brief discussion of optimization with single variable function.

Working Rules for Finding of Maximum, Minimum and Point of Inflection of a Function with Single Variable: 
Step 1: Differentiate the given function and equate to zero and also find the roots. (i.e. find dx dy and put dx dy = 0. Calculate the stationary point.) Local maxima and minima can be determined from the first and second derivatives. 
Step 2: Again differentiate the given function and put the values of roots in this second derivative function one by one (i.e. compute 2 2 dx d y at these stationary points). 
Step 3: If the second derivative is positive for a root then the given function is minimum. On the other hand, if the second derivative is negative for a root then the given function is maximum.
