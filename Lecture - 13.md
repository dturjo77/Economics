The Feasibility Study for the Engineering Project

A feasibility study is a detailed analysis that considers all of the critical aspects of a proposed project in order to determine the likelihood of it succeeding. Success in business may be defined primarily by return on investment, meaning that the project will generate enough profit to justify the investment. Conducting a feasibility study ensures that your project will go smoothly. Any large project that involves engineering is likely to require a lot of time, money, and effort. Before embarking on such a commitment, it is wise to conduct a feasibility study.

The feasibility study for the engineering project is a means to achieve the economic, administrative and social objectives of the project, which leads to achieving the use of the best equipment and mechanisms for implementation and also the optimal use of the available human, material and financial resources in the best methods and with the utmost precision.

When studying the feasibility of an engineering project, the size and type of the project must be determined. Is it a construction engineering project, a project specializing in the field of roads and transportation, or a project specializing in production workshops and mechanical and electrical maintenance of engines and machines or other engineering fields, in order to know how the feasibility study will be conducted for the project to determine the nature of the products and its characteristics? A clear pricing plan for the products must be developed in order to know how the marketing and promotional plan for the project's products will take place.

The feasibility study in engineering projects aims at a number of main points:

• Knowing the extent to which the project can achieve its required objectives.
• Determine the best investment options for the project implementer among the various alternatives.
• Estimating the time required to complete project implementation and the expected financial cost of the project.
• Make a clear plan for the project financing process throughout the implementation period. Will the investor be able to finance the project in cash, or will he need marketing strategies to attract and convince other investors in the project to support the project financially, or will banks agree to finance part of the project?
• Identifying problems and obstacles that the project may face during and after implementation.
• Know how the project will affect and be affected by the surrounding environment.

The economic feasibility study depends on the following elements:

Financial Evaluation

Among the financial evaluation methods:

1. Calculating the project's annual revenues.
2. Calculating Annual Project Expenditures. They are divided into:
   • Fixed Expenses: They do not change with the quantities produced, such as wages and salaries for indirect workers, water consumption, etc.
   • Variable Expenses: They change with changes in the quantities produced, such as wages and salaries for direct labor, electricity, raw materials, and others.
3. Calculating annual profits and losses: This is done by subtracting annual expenses from annual revenues.

Economic Evaluation

Among these methods:

• Net annual profits after deducting income tax.
• Payback Period: It is described by the following equation: Payback Period = Capital Investment/Annual net profits
• Annual Rate of Return: It is described by the following equation: Annual rate of return = (Net annual profits × 100%) / capital investment. This is what the project recovers from the invested capital per year, taken as a percentage.
• Break Even Point: It is the point that is described as the point of no profit and no loss.
• External Rate of Return: It is the interest rate that generates a future value equal to zero assuming reinvestment at the minimum attractive rate of return for investment.
• Internal Rate of Return: It is the most widely used method in evaluating projects, and it is the discount rate that gives a present value equal to zero.

What is Economic Growth?

Economic growth can be referred to as the increase that is witnessed in the monetary value of all the goods and services produced in the economy during a time period. It is a type of quantitative measure that reflects the potential increase in the number of business transactions taking place in the economy.

It can be measured in terms of the increase in the aggregate market value of additional goods and services produced by using economic concepts such as GDP and GNP.

Economic growth is a narrow concept when compared to economic development.

What is Economic Development?

Economic development refers to the process by which the overall health, well-being, and academic level of the general population of a nation improves. It also refers to the improved production volume due to the advancements of technology.

It is the qualitative improvement in the life of the citizens of a country and is most appropriately determined by the Human Development Index (HDI). The overall development of a country is based on many parameters such as the creation of job opportunities, technological advancements, standard of living, living conditions, per capita income, quality of life, improvement in self-esteem needs, GDP, industrial and infrastructural development, etc.

Let us look into the most significant points of difference between economic growth and economic development from the following table:

Determinants of economic development

Economic development is influenced by a range of complex, interconnected economic and non-economic factors. While the exact determinants can vary between developed and developing countries, the core components consistently highlighted in academic literature.

The primary determinants can be categorized as follows:

Economic Determinants

Capital Formation: This includes physical capital (infrastructure, machinery, etc.), human capital (education and skills of the workforce), and financial capital (domestic savings and foreign investment). High savings rates and effective capital markets are crucial for investment.

Natural Resources: The availability and sustainable management of natural resources (land, minerals, etc.) can be a significant driver of growth, though mismanagement can hinder progress.

Technology and Innovation: The application of better techniques and research & development leads to increased efficiency and production. Technological progress is often considered a key economic determinant of sustained growth.

Market Size and Structure: Access to robust domestic and international markets facilitates the exchange of goods and services and can boost export activity.

Infrastructure: Adequate power, transportation, and communication systems are essential for industrial activity and overall economic progress.

Trade and Foreign Investment: Openness to international trade and the attraction of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) can positively influence economic growth, particularly in developing countries.

Non-Economic and Institutional Determinants

Political Stability and Governance: A stable political environment, strong rule of law, and effective control of corruption are critical for fostering a predictable investment climate and attracting capital. Political instability can negatively affect growth.

Social Structures and Cultural Values: The patterns of social relationships, cultural values, and religious beliefs can either promote or hinder economic development. Factors like social stratification and gender discrimination can create barriers to economic participation.

Institutional Quality: The presence of robust, efficient, and transparent institutions is crucial for implementing sound policies and ensuring the benefits of growth are maximized and sustained.

Geography and Demographics: Geographic location (e.g., distance to major world cities for trade access) and demographic factors like population growth rates and health levels are also linked to growth variations across countries.

Malthus's theory of development centers on his famous population principle: population grows geometrically (exponentially), while food supply grows arithmetically (linearly), inevitably leading to resource scarcity, poverty, famine, disease, and war (positive checks) unless people practice "preventive checks" like moral restraint and delayed marriage, creating a cycle where prosperity spurs growth until a catastrophe resets it, a concept known as the Malthusian Trap. While influential, it's criticized for underestimating technology and human adaptability, but it highlights critical links between population, resources, and living standards for economic development discussions.

Core Concepts of Malthusian Theory

• Geometric vs. Arithmetic Growth: Population (1, 2, 4, 8...) outpaces food supply (1, 2, 3, 4...).
• Malthusian Trap: A self-limiting cycle where economic growth boosts population, but resource limits cause living standards to fall back to subsistence levels, triggering crises.
• Checks on Population:
  ○ Preventive Checks: Voluntary limits like delaying marriage or sexual restraint (moral restraint).
  ○ Positive Checks: Involuntary increases in mortality (famine, disease, war) due to resource scarcity.

Malthus on Economic Development

• Capital Accumulation: He emphasized capital investment (especially in agriculture) and foreign trade as vital for increasing wealth and development.
• Demand & Gluts: Malthus also discussed "gluts" (excess supply) and argued for balancing production with consumption, anticipating Keynesian ideas about demand.

Rostow's five stages of economic development describe a nation's journey from traditional agriculture to modern consumerism: 1) Traditional Society (subsistence farming, hierarchy), 2) Preconditions for Take-off (infrastructure, education, investment starts), 3) Take-off (rapid industrial growth in key sectors), 4) Drive to Maturity (diversification, technology spreads), and 5) Age of High Mass Consumption (consumer goods dominate, high living standards). This linear model charts a path from agrarian life to an industrialized, service-based economy.

The Five Stages:

1. Traditional Society: A pre-scientific society with limited technology, where most people are farmers and wealth is invested in non-productive areas (like military/religion).

2. Preconditions for Take-off: Society begins investing in infrastructure (roads, banks) and education, leading to social and political changes and increased productivity.

3. Take-off: A period of rapid industrial growth, driven by a few key industries, leading to self-sustaining economic expansion and a shift to manufacturing.

4. Drive to Maturity: Technology spreads to all sectors, the economy diversifies, and the workforce becomes more skilled, supported by infrastructure.

5. Age of High Mass Consumption: Focus shifts from heavy industry to producing durable consumer goods and services, leading to high living standards and widespread purchasing power.
