What Is Inflation?

Inflation is the rate at which the price of goods and services increases over time. It can affect nearly any product or service, including need-based expenses such as housing, food, medical care, and utilities, as well as want-based expenses such as cosmetics, automobiles, and jewelry. Once inflation becomes prevalent throughout an economy, the expectation of further inflation becomes an overriding concern in the consciousness of consumers and businesses.

Inflation can also be thought of as the devaluation of money. It can be a concern because it makes money saved in the present less valuable in the future. Inflation erodes both purchasing power and the value of investments. For example, if an investor earned 5% from investments in stocks and bonds, but the inflation rate was 3%, the investor only earned 2% in real terms.

There are many potential root causes of inflation:

• Cost-push inflation
• Demand-pull inflation
• Built-in inflation
• The housing market
• Expansionary monetary and fiscal policy
• Monetary devaluation

Demand-pull inflation

Demand-pull inflation arises when the total demand for goods and services (i.e. ‘aggregate demand’) increases to exceed the supply of goods and services (i.e. ‘aggregate supply’) that can be sustainably produced. The excess demand puts upward pressure on prices across a broad range of goods and services and ultimately leads to an increase in inflation – that is, it ‘pulls’ inflation higher.

Aggregate demand might increase because there is an increase in spending by consumers, businesses or government, or an increase in net exports. As a result, demand for goods and services will increase relative to their supply, providing scope for firms to increase prices (and their margins – which is their mark-up on costs). At the same time, firms will seek to employ more workers to meet this extra demand. With increased demand for labour, firms may have to offer higher wages to attract new staff and retain their existing employees. Firms may also increase the prices of their goods and services to cover their higher labour costs.⁴ More jobs and higher wages increase household incomes and lead to a rise in consumer spending, further increasing aggregate demand and the scope for firms to increase the prices of their goods and services. When this happens across a large number of businesses and sectors, this leads to an increase in inflation.

The opposite will happen when aggregate demand decreases; firms facing lower demand will either pause hiring or make staff redundant which means that fewer staff are required. This puts upward pressure on the unemployment rate. More workers searching for jobs means that firms can offer lower wages, putting downward pressure on household incomes, consumer spending and the prices of their goods and services. As a result, inflation will decrease.

Causes or factors of Demand-Pull Inflation

There are five primary causes of demand-pull inflation:

1. A growing economy: When consumers feel confident, they spend more and take on more debt. This leads to a steady increase in demand, which means higher prices.

2. Increasing export demand: A sudden rise in exports forces an undervaluation of the currencies involved.

3. Government spending: When the government spends more freely, prices go up.

4. Inflation expectations: Companies may increase their prices if they anticipate inflation.

5. More money in the system: An expansion of the money supply with too few goods to buy makes prices increase.

Cost-push inflation

Cost-push inflation occurs when the total supply of goods and services in the economy which can be produced (aggregate supply) falls. A fall in aggregate supply is often caused by an increase in the cost of production. If aggregate supply falls but aggregate demand remains unchanged, there is upward pressure on prices and inflation – that is, inflation is ‘pushed’ higher.

An increase in the price of domestic or imported inputs (such as oil or raw materials) pushes up production costs. As firms are faced with higher costs of producing each unit of output they tend to produce a lower level of output and raise the prices of their goods and services. This can have flow-on effects by pushing up the prices of other goods and services. For example, an increase in the price of oil, which is a major input in many sectors of the economy, will initially lead to higher petrol prices. However, higher petrol prices will also make it more expensive to transport goods from one location to another which, in turn, will result in increased prices for items like groceries.

Cost-push inflation can also arise due to supply disruptions in specific industries – for example, due to unusual weather or natural disasters. Periodically, there are major cyclones and floods that damage large volumes of agricultural produce and result in significant increases in the price of processed food and both takeaway and restaurant meals, resulting in temporary periods of higher inflation.

Cost-Push Inflation Factors

Increased Raw Material Costs: A rise in the prices of essential raw materials like oil or other resources can increase production costs for many businesses.

Higher Labor Costs: Increases in wages or benefits for workers raise the overall cost of production for firms.

Higher Indirect Taxes: An increase in taxes on goods and services can be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.

Shortages: A decrease in the supply of certain goods or factors of production (like labor or raw materials) can drive up their prices, increasing production costs.
