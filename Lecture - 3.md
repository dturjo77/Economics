CHAPTER SIX  
THEORY OF PRODUCTION and COSTS  

6.1 Some Basic Concepts of Production Theory  

6.1.1 Production Defined  

This chapter examines the theory of producer behavior which is the supply side of the market.  

In this theory of production, firms organize/combine resources or inputs such as labor, capital, land and  
entrepreneurship and so on, to produce final goods and services. Thus, production refers to the process  
of converting inputs into outputs. In other words, production is the creation of goods and services from  
inputs or resources, such as labor, machinery and other capital equipment, land, raw materials, and so  
on.  

Example: when a company such as Ford makes a truck or car or when Exxon refines a gallon of  
gasoline, the activity is production. But production goes much further than that. A doctor produces  
medical services, a teacher produces education, and a singer produces entertainment. So production  
involves services as well as making the goods people buy. Production is also undertaken by  
governments and non-profit organizations. A city police department produces protection, a public  
school produces education, and a hospital produces health care.  

The following points are worth noting about the notion of production:  

• Production may not involve physical conversion of raw materials into tangible goods. Some  
kinds of production may involve an intangible input to produce an intangible output. For example,  
in the production of legal, medical, social and consultancy services both input and output are  
intangible. Lawyers, doctors, social workers, consultants, hairdressers, musicians, orchestra players  
are all engaged in producing intangible goods.  

• Production process may take a variety of forms other than manufacturing. For example,  
transporting a commodity from one place to another where it can be used is production. Such  
activities too are 'production'. Storing a commodity for future sale or consumption is also  
'production'. Wholesaling, retailing, packaging, assembling are all productive activities. These  
activities are just as good examples of production as manufacturing.  

6.1.2 An Input  

An input is a good or service that goes into the process of production. In other words, an input is  
simply anything which the firm buys for use in its production or other process for sale.  

Inputs can be classified into  
1. Labor (including entrepreneurial talent);  
2. Capital;  
3. Land or natural resources;  
4. Raw materials;  
5. Times.  

Inputs are also classified as (i) fixed inputs (ii) variable inputs. A fixed input is one for which the level  
of usage cannot readily be changed. To be sure, no input is ever absolutely fixed, no matter how short  
the period of time under consideration. However, the cost of immediately varying the use of an input  
may be so great that, for all practical purposes, the input is fixed. For example, buildings, major pieces  
of machinery, and managerial personnel are inputs that generally cannot be rapidly augmented or  
diminished. A variable input, on the other hand, is one for which the level of usage may be changed  
quite readily in response to desired changes in output. Many types of labor services as well as certain  
raw and processed materials would be this category.  

6.1.3 An Output  

On the other hand, is any good or service that comes out of production process.  
• The output of a firm can be a final commodity out (such as home automobile) or an intermediate  
product, such as semiconductors (which are used in the production of computers and other goods).  
• The output can be a service rather than a good. Examples of services are education, medicine,  
banking, communication, transportation, and many others.  

6.1.4 Short-run and Long-run  

The short-run refers to a period of time in which the supply of certain inputs (example, plant, building,  
and machines, etc.) is fixed or inelastic. In the short-run, therefore, production of a commodity can be  
increased by increasing the use of only variable inputs, like labor and raw materials. Long-run refers to  
a period of time in which the supply of all the inputs is elastic, but not enough to permit a change in  
technology. That is, in the long run, all the inputs are variable. Therefore, in the long-run production of  
a commodity can be increased by employing more or both, variable and fixed, inputs. To sum up, it  
can be said that the firm operates in the short-run and plans increases or reductions in its scale of  
operation in the long run.

6.2 Production Function

A production function is the link between levels of input usage and attainable levels of output. That is, the production formally describes the relation between physical rates of output and physical rates of input usage. A production function is a schedule (or table or mathematical equation) showing the maximum amount of output that can be produced from any specified set of inputs, given the existing technology or rate of the art of production.

Q = f(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)

For the sake of illustration, let's consider the simple case of production function in which only two inputs are involved in the production process (usually labor and capital).

Q = f(L,K)

Where, Q = Quantity produced;

L = Labor

K = Capital

However, we must stress that the principles to be developed apply to situations with more than two points and, as well, to inputs other than capital and labor.

6.2.1 Technical Efficiency and Economic Efficiency

Technical efficiency is achieved when the maximum possible amount of output is being produced with a given combination of inputs. The definition of a production function assumes that technical efficiency is being achieved because the production function gives the maximum output level that can be achieved for any particular combination of inputs. Thus, technical efficiency is implied by the production function.

Economic efficiency is achieved when the firm is producing a given amount of output at the lowest possible cost. One should be careful about labeling a particular production process inefficient. Certainly a process would be technically inefficient if another process can produce the same amount of output using less or one or more inputs and the same amounts of all others. If, however, the second process uses less of some inputs but more of others, the economically efficient method of producing a given level of output depends on the prices of the inputs. Even when both are technically efficient, one process might cost less- be economically efficient- under one set of input prices while the other may be economically efficient at other input prices.

6.3 Production Function in the Short Run (Optimization in the Case of one Variable Input)

The supply of the fixed inputs remained unchanged (i.e., supply inelastic) so that there are only one variable input and one fixed input. Thus, production of a commodity increased by using more of the variable inputs. In the short run, the firm faces a decision problem on how much of variable inputs should be employed with a given employment of fixed inputs. To address this issue, one needs a clear understanding of relationship among the total, average, and marginal productivity of factors.

Total Product (TP): the total amount of output produced as a result of employing all the inputs.

TP = Q = f(L,K) = f(L)

Suppose a firm with a production function of the form Q = f(L,K) can, in the long run, choose levels of both labor and capital between 0 and 10 units. A production function giving the maximum amount of output that can be produced from every possible combination of labor and capital is shown in Table 6.1. For example, from the table, 4 units of labor combined with 3 units of capital can produce a maximum of 325 units of output; 6 labor and 6 capital can produce a maximum of 655 units of output; and so on. Note that with 0 capital, no output can be produced regardless of the level of labor usage. Likewise, with 0 labor, there can be no output.

Once the level of capital is fixed, the firm is in the short run, and output can be changed only by varying the amount of labor employed. Assume now that the capital stock is fixed at 2 units of capital. The firm is in the short run and can vary only by varying the usage of labor (the variable input). The column in Table 6.1 under 2 units of capital gives the total output, or total product of labor, for 0 through 10 workers. This column, for which K = 2, represents the short-run production function when capital is fixed at 2 units.

These total products are reproduced in column 2 of Table 6.1 for each level of labor usage in column 1. Thus, columns 1 and 2 in Table 6.2 define a production function of the form Q = f(L,K), where K = 2. In this example, total product (Q) rises with increases in labor up to a point (9 workers) and then declines. While total product does eventually fall as more workers if they knew output would fall. A manager can hire either 8 workers or 10 workers to produce 314 units of output. Obviously, the economically efficient amount of labor to hire to produce 314 units is eight workers.

Average Product (AP): the total product per unit of variable input.

AP = TP/L = Q/L

In our example, average product, shown in column 3, first rises, reaches a maximum at 56.7, then declines thereafter.

Marginal Product (MP): is the additional output attributable to using one additional worker with the use of all other inputs fixed (in this case, at 2 units of capital). That is,

MP = ΔTP/ΔL = ΔQ/ΔL

where Δ means "the change in." The marginal product schedule associated with the production function in Table 6.2 is shown in column 4 of the table. Because no output can be produced with 0 workers, the first worker adds 52 units of output; the second adds 60 units (i.e., increase output from 52 to 112); and so on.

Table 6.2 Total, Average, and Marginal Products of Labor (with capital fixed at 2 units)

Note that increasing the amount of labor from 9 to 10 actually decreases output from 318 to 314. Thus, the marginal product of the 10^{th} worker is negative. In this example, marginal product first increases as the amount of labor increases, then decreases, and finally becomes negative. This is a pattern frequently assumed in economic analysis.

Figure 6.1 shows graphically the relations among the total, average, and marginal products set forth in Table 6.2. In Panel A, total product increases up to 9 workers, then decreases. Panel B incorporates a common assumption made in production theory: Average product first rises then falls. When average product is increasing, marginal product is greater than average product (after the first worker, at which they are equal). When average product is decreasing, marginal product is less than average product. This result is not peculiar to this production function; it occurs for any production function for which average product first increases then decreases.

An example might help demonstrate that for any average and marginal schedule, the average must increase when the marginal is above the average and decrease when the marginal is below the average. If you have taken two tests and made grades of 70 and 80, your average grade is 75. If your third test grade is higher than 75, the marginal grade is above the average the average, so your average grade increases. Conversely, if your third grade is less than 75- the marginal grade is below the average- your average falls. In production theory, if each additional worker adds more than the average, average product rises; if each additional worker adds less than the average, average product falls.

As shown in Figure 6.1, marginal product first increases then decreases, becoming negative after 9 workers. The maximum marginal product occurs before the maximum average product is attained. When marginal product is increasing, total product increases at an increasing rate. When marginal product begins to increase at a decreasing rate. When marginal product becomes negative (10 workers), total product declines.

We can derive the following important relationship between TP, AP and MP:

AP ↑ when MP > AP

AP ↓ when MP < AP

AP reaches max imum when AP = MP

MP = 0 when TP reaches max imum

MP reaches max imum before AP

MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN APL AND MPL

The mathematical relationship between the average product of labor (or any average concept) and the marginal product of labor (or any related marginal concept) may be illustrated by the use of optimization analysis.

Consider again the definition of the average product of labor

AP_L = \frac{TP_L}{L} = \frac{Q_L}{L} = \frac{f(K_0, L)}{L}

Taking the first derivative with respect to labor and setting the results equal to zero yields

\frac{\partial AP_L}{\partial L} = \frac{L(\partial Q_L / \partial L) - Q_L (\partial L / \partial L)}{L^2} = 0

\frac{\partial AP_L}{\partial L} = \frac{L(MP_L) - Q_L (1)}{L^2} = 0

\frac{MP_L}{L} - \frac{Q_L}{L^2} = \frac{MP_L}{L} - \frac{Q_L}{L} \times \frac{1}{L} = \frac{1}{L} (MP_L - AP_L) = 0

\frac{1}{L}(MP_L - AP_L) = 0 when AP is maximum, then MP_L = AP_L.

\frac{1}{L}(MP_L - AP_L) = +ve when AP is rising, then MP_L = AP_L (+ve)

Meaning MP_L > AP_L.

\frac{1}{L}(MP_L - AP_L) = -ve when AP is declining, then MP_L = AP_L (-ve)

Meaning MP_L < AP_L.
